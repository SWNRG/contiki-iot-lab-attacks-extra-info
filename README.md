This is a standard contiki fork from fit-iot-lab https://github.com/iot-lab/contiki which is a fork from original contiki OS.
I just added some extra printouts and functions to show more details under various attacks.
look for specific code in ../examples/ipv6/ 
Do "grep -r "George"" (NOT Oikonomou) to find my additions
